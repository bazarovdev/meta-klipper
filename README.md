# meta-klipper
A begining of Yocto layer that holds recipes for  Klipper, Moonraker, Mainsail and their dependencies.
Motivated from https://github.com/jin-eld/klipper-linux but removes patches and makes it as an independent layer.

There are additional mentioning that such a layer already exists in https://github.com/bitsy-ai/printnanny-os but didn't find it in github.
