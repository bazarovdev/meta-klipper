# Meta-Klipper
A begining of Yocto layer that holds recipes for  Klipper, Moonraker, Mainsail and their dependencies.

Motivated from [https://github.com/jin-eld/klipper-linux](https://github.com/jin-eld/klipper-linux) but removes patches and makes it as an independent layer.

There are additional mentioning that such a layer already exists in [PrintNanny-OS](https://github.com/bitsy-ai/printnanny-os) but I didn't find it in github.  
**Update:** now the recipes are available here: [meta-printnanny](https://github.com/bitsy-ai/meta-bitsy/tree/main/meta-printnanny)
